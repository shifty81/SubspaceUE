## Example Usage

### Creating a Ship Entity

```csharp
var engine = new GameEngine(12345);
engine.Start();

// Create entity
var ship = engine.EntityManager.CreateEntity("Player Ship");

// Add voxel structure
var voxelComponent = new VoxelStructureComponent();
voxelComponent.AddBlock(new VoxelBlock(new Vector3(0, 0, 0), new Vector3(2, 2, 2), "Iron"));
engine.EntityManager.AddComponent(ship.Id, voxelComponent);

// Add physics
var physicsComponent = new PhysicsComponent
{
    Position = new Vector3(100, 100, 100),
    Mass = voxelComponent.TotalMass
};
engine.EntityManager.AddComponent(ship.Id, physicsComponent);

// Update engine (call in game loop)
engine.Update();
```

### Using the Scripting API

```csharp
var engine = new GameEngine();

// Execute Lua script
engine.ExecuteScript(@"
    function createShip(name)
        log('Creating ship: ' .. name)
        -- Access engine from Lua
        return name
    end
");

// Call Lua function
var result = engine.ScriptingEngine.CallFunction("createShip", "MyShip");
```

### Starting Multiplayer Server

```csharp
var engine = new GameEngine();
engine.StartServer(27015); // Start on port 27015
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ".NET SDK is not installed" or "dotnet command not found"
- **Solution**: Install .NET 9.0 SDK from [dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- After installation, restart your terminal/command prompt
- Verify with: `dotnet --version`

#### "The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET 9.0"
- **Solution**: Your .NET SDK version is too old. Download and install .NET 9.0 SDK or later
- Check your version: `dotnet --version`
- Multiple SDK versions can coexist peacefully

#### NuGet package restore fails
- **Solution**: Check your internet connection
- Try clearing the NuGet cache: `dotnet nuget locals all --clear`
- Then run: `dotnet restore` again

#### Build errors related to NLua
- **Solution**: Make sure NuGet packages are restored correctly
- Run: `dotnet restore` in the AvorionLike project directory
- If issues persist, delete `bin` and `obj` folders and rebuild

#### Permission denied when running setup scripts (Linux/macOS)
- **Solution**: Make the script executable
- Run: `chmod +x setup.sh` or `chmod +x check-prerequisites.sh`

#### Script execution disabled (Windows PowerShell)
- **Solution**: You may need to change the execution policy
- Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```
- Then try running the setup script again

#### Application crashes or unexpected behavior
- **Solution**: Make sure you built the project successfully
- Try a clean build: Delete `bin` and `obj` folders, then run `dotnet build`
- Check that you're running .NET 9.0 or later: `dotnet --version`
